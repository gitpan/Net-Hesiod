Revision history for Perl extension Net::Hesiod.
1.11  Tue Sep 10 19:08:00 2002
	Some minor changes in installation.  No changes in actual module, just
	will now search for hesiod stuff a bit better.  Also trying to make
	more compatible for CPAN module installs.
1.10  Tue Apr 24 13:00:00 2001
	Discovered that hesiod_getservbyname IS functioning properly by
	returning port number in network byte order.  Not well documented
	in DEC man pages.  So removed HESIOD_PORT_ENDIAN_HACK, and automatcally
	do a ntohs for everything.  (Perl gerservbyname gives port in host
	byte order, so we stick with that).
1.00  Mon Apr 23 18:00:00 2001
	Installed and tested on alpha-dec_osf, i386-linux, and sun4-solaris
